Project 1
Sprint 4

+ Updated failed sprint 3 with all data for that sprint now appearing in one database
+ Generated a second database table specifically to include location data (longitude and latitude, etc)
+ With this data, I created a plotly map with help from  geopandas and geopy to put display all the jobs and their locations on the map
