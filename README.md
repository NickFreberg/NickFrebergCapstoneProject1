Project 1
Sprint 2

What's Missing: 
1. After countless attempts, I was still unable to get my data to print to the db
[note: my main issue was in creating the function to inject data. "Unable to resolve table/column" errors]
Had I been able to fix this (which I feel is so simple yet I can't grasp it) the actual code would be all set
2. A few automated tests are missing
